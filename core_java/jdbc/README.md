# Introduction
Using Java as the main programming language and some of it's main modules such as HTTP, JSON and SQL modules imported by the use of Maven to take Stock data from a specific server and store it into a database. 
The project is conceived like a first instance app with the controller implementation being done on the terminal for any user to actually use it properly.
The main repositories patterns are inspired from Maven wich indlude a main directory for all the classes that will be used in the app and also a test directory for all the test methods that will be implemented.
